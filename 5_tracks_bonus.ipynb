    "# Train Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "A train network operator wants to find the minimum number of parallel tracks in the train network so that mean delay is smaller than 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The network has ten track segments and five stations. Each segment has a fixed number of parallel tracks that indicate how many trains can be on the segment at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of parallel tracks can only be set for all segments at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each train has a departure station and an arrival station. These are randomly chosen from the five stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A train must pass through a sequence of segments in the correct order to reach its destination. The sequence of segments that a train must pass through is determined by the departure and arrival stations of the train. Passing thorugh one segment always takes 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a train requests access to a segment, it must wait until a track becomes available. The time spent waiting is recorded in a list called `delays`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After a train has passed through a segment, it continues on to the next segment in the sequence until it reaches its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 500 trains. 25 Trains are ready to leave the station every 30 minutes beginning at minute 0 of the simulation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The network operator wants to keep the mean delay below 30 minutes.<br>\n",
    "Determine the minimum number of parallel tracks that achieve that goal. <br>\n",
    "Consider 800 operational minutes of the network. <br>\n",
    "There is no need to account for possible trains who have not arrived\n",
    "in their destination after the operational minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "Setup the simulation and find the optimal capacity for the resources according to the business goal.<br>\n",
    "Do so, by utilizing the code which plots the performance against the capacity.<br>\n",
    "Use comments to provide your answer.<br>\n",
    "It is not required to comment your code.<br>\n",
    "However, it may help yourself and us to keep track of what you're doing.\n",
